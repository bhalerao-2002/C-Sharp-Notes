# Selenium: 
- Selenium is a set of open-source web automation tools that leverages the power of web browsers and helps automate workflows of how users interact with the web application within the browser

### Selenium Advantages:
- Open-source tool
- Extended for various technologies.
- Capabilities to execute scripts across different browsers.
- Execute scripts on various operating systems.
- Supports mobile devices.
- Can execute tests in parallel with the use of Selenium Grids.

### Selenium Disadvantages:
- Supports only web based applications.
- No feature such as Object Repository/Recovery Scenario
- No IDE, so the script development won't be as fast as QTP.
- Cannot access controls within the browser.
- No default test report generation.
- For parameterization, users has to rely on the programming language.

## Components of Selenium:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e29617-c827-452e-996f-f2316db5f38d)
- Selenium IDE
  - It is an extension available for browsers, which has the record and replay functionality available.
- Selenium RC
  - It is a server that acts as a middleman between the user and the browser that needs to interact. It had issues with the **One Origin Policy** and was deprecated in favor of WebDriver.
- Selenium WebDriver
  - WebDriver allows users to write custom code in their language of choice and interact with the browser of their choice, through browser-specific drivers. WebDriver works on the OS level and uses a Protocol called **JSONWireProtocol** to communicate with browsers.
- Selenium GRID
  - It allows users to run tests on different machines, with different browsers and OS simultaneously, which gives the ability to run tests in parallel, as such saving a lot of time and resources testing on several machines.
 
## Which Selenium Testing tool fits your need?
- Selenium IDE
  - If you want to learn about automation testing and Selenium.
  - If you have little or no prior experience in test automation.
  - In case you want to write simple test cases and export them later for RC or WebDriver.
  - If you want to execute customized JavaScript code using runScript
  - If you want to export the script in various languages.
  - In case you want to target Chrome and Firefox for testing.
- Selenium RC
  - If you want to write test cases in more expressive language than IDE.
  - If you want to test the application against a new browser that supports JavaScript.
  - Or, if you want to test an application, that is AJAX heavy.
- Selenium WebDriver
  - If you want to use a specific programming language for your automation test cases.
  - If you want to test applications in different platforms using Selenium Grid
  - Or, if you want to test applications in CI/CD.
  - If you want to test applications and generate customized HTML formatted reports.
  - If you want to test modern dynamic data-heavy websites.
- Selenium GRID
  - If you want to run your automation test cases in different browsers and operating systems simultaneously.
  - If you want to run a vast test suite and want to minimize the execution time.
 

# Selenium WebDrivers
- Selenium WebDriver is a set of open-source APIs, which provided the capabilities to interact with any of the modern web-browsers and then, in-turn to automate the user actions with that browser.
- Selenium WebDriver is a component of the Selenium family. Itâ€™s the introduction in the system lead to overcome a few of the shortcomings of Selenium RC.
- Selenium WebDriver is a set of APIs, which makes the interaction and actions on the browser very easy and quick.
- Selenium WebDriver provides quite a few unique features, such as it can automate dynamic web pages. Additionally, it can automate all the web applications, no matter in which programming language we use to develop them.
- Selenium WebDriver interacts with the browsers with the help of various drivers provided by corresponding Vendors.


## Why Selenium WebDriver is popular?
- Multi-Browser Compatibility.
- Multi-Language Support
- Faster Execution
- Locating Web Elements
- Handling dynamic web elements.
  - Absolute Xpath
  - Contains()
  - Starts-With()
- Handling Waiting for Elements 

## What are the drawbacks of Selenium WebDriver?
- Requires Programming Knowledge and Expertise
- No Support for Desktop Applications
- No Customer Support
- No Built In Object Repository
- Lack of built-in reporting
- Managing Browser-Selenium Dependencies

## How Selenium WebDriver works?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1f441fe-9b6f-47ce-b70c-01d508b750c4)
When a user writes a WebDriver code in Selenium and executes it, the following actions happen in the background â€“
- An HTTP request generates, and it goes to the respective browser driver (Chrome, IE, Firefox). There is an individual request for each Selenium command.
- The browser driver receives the request through an HTTP server.
- The HTTP server decides which actions/instructions need to execute on the browser.
- The browser executes the instructions/steps as decided above.
- The HTTP server then receives the execution status and then sends back the status to an automation script, which then shows the result ( as passed or an exception or error).


### Basic Script of Selenium WebDriver in JAVA


Task we intended to perform in this script is:
- Firstly, open the browser.
- Secondly, navigate to the ToolsQA Demo Website.
- Thirdly, maximize the browser window.
- After that, retrieve the title of the page.
- Fifthly, log in to the Website by specifying credentials.
- Sixthly, validate the LogOut button is visible.
- Lastly, we logout from the Website.

Code:
```
package WebDriversBasics;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class launch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        1. open the browser.
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\ramerus\\Downloads\\chromedriver-win64\\chromedriver.exe");
        WebDriver RushiDriver = new ChromeDriver();

//        2. navigate to the ToolsQA Demo Website.
        RushiDriver.get("https://demoqa.com/login");

//        3. maximize the browser window.
        RushiDriver.manage().window().maximize();

//        4. retrieve the title of the page.
        String title = RushiDriver.getTitle();
        System.out.println("The page title is: " + title);

//        5. log in to the Website by specifying credentials.
        WebElement uName = RushiDriver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='userName']"));
        WebElement pswd = RushiDriver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='password']"));
        WebElement loginBtn = RushiDriver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='login']"));

        uName.sendKeys("testuser");
        pswd.sendKeys("Password@123");
        loginBtn.click();

//        6. validate the LogOut button is visible.
//        7. we logout from the Website.
        try{
            WebElement logoutBtn = RushiDriver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@class='text-right col-md-5 col-sm-12']//button[@id='submit']"));

            if(logoutBtn.isDisplayed()){
                logoutBtn.click();
                System.out.println("LogOut Success ðŸ˜Š");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println("Ahhh...ðŸ˜’");
        }
//        8. Close the Browser
        RushiDriver.quit();
    }
}
```

## Browser Commands in Selenium WebDriver:
driver._______
#### A. Basic
1. get(String arg0): void
  1. It opens the URL provided as String.
2. getTitle(): String
  1. Returns title of the Webpage.
3. getCurrentUrl(): String
  1. Returns the current URL which is opened in the browser.
4. getPageSource(): String
   1. Returns the source code of the page.
5. close(): void
  1. Close only the current Window the WebDriver is currently controlling. 
6. quit(): void
   1. Closes all windows opend by the WebDriver.

#### B. Intermediate

#### C. Advanced

## Browser Navigation Command
driver.navigate().________
1. to(String arg0) : void
   1. Loads new web page(provided url) in current browser window
2. forward() : void
   1. This method does the same operation as clicking on the Forward(Next) Button of any browser
3. back() : void
   1. This method does the same operation as clicking on the Back Button of any browser.
4. refresh() : void
   1. This method Refresh the current page.
  

## WebElement Commands
WebElements are HTML elements.
So, to get the WebElement object write the below statement:
```WebElement Rushielement = driver.findElement(By.id("UserName"));```
