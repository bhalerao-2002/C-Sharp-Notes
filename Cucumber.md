### Benefits of TDD
- Unit test proves that the code actually works
- Can drive the design of the program
- Refactoring allows improving the design of the code
- Low-Level regression test suite
- Test first reduce the cost of the bugs
### Drawbacks of TDD
- Developer can consider it as a waste of time
- The test can be targeted on verification of classes and methods and not on what the code really should do
- Test become part of the maintenance overhead of a project
- Rewrite the test when requirements change

## Behaviour Driven Development :
Behavior Driven testing is an extension of TDD. Like in TDD in BDD also we write tests first and the add application code. The major difference that we get to see here are

- Tests are written in plain descriptive English type grammar
- Tests are explained as behavior of application and are more user-focused
- Using examples to clarify requirements


## BDD Tools Cucumber & SpecFlow

### What is Cucumber?
Cucumber is a testing framework which supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It lets us define application behavior in plain meaningful English text using a simple grammar defined by a language called Gherkin. Cucumber itself is written in Ruby, but it can be used to “test” code written in Ruby or other languages including but not limited to Java, C# and Python.

### What is SpecFlow?
SpecFlow is inspired by Cucumber framework in the Ruby on Rails world. Cucumber uses plain English in the Gherkin format to express user stories. Once the user stories and their expectations are written, the Cucumber gem is used to execute those stores. SpecFlow brings the same concept to the .NET world and allows the developer to express the feature in plain English language. It also allows to write specification in human-readable Gherkin format.
